Please make sure the installation :ref:`pre-requisite-reference-label` are met.

This example shows how to verify an HDF file structure.
This example takes two mandatory command line arguments:
conf: a string defining the configuration file. If only path is defined, the name 'dqconfig.ini'
file: a file to be verified.

The configuration file will have the following definitions:
'schema' - file name including path that contains schema that the file is checked against.
           Example of schema file: doc/source/config/dqschemas/basicHDF.json
'log_file' - defines log file. If not configured, the software will create default.log file in the working directory. 
'verification_type' - defines how the file is verified. If the type is "hdf_tags", the file will be checked for the presence
of listed tags; if the type is "hdf_structure", the tags, and listed attributes are checked.

This test can be done at the end of data collection to verify that the collected data file is not
corrupted.
