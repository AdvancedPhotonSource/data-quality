Please make sure the installation :ref:`pre-requisite-reference-label` are met.

This example shows how to verify that the list of PV/PV-value conditions listed
in the pvs.jason configured file are satisfied.
This example takes one mandatory command line argument:
conf: a string defining the configuration file. If only path is defined, the name 'dqconfig_test.ini'

The configuration file will have the following definitions:
'pv_file' - file name including path that contain process variables requirements. Example of pv file: 
                 doc/source/config/dqschemas/pvs.json
'log_file' - defines log file. If not configured, the software will create default.log file in the working directory.

This test can be done at the beginning of a scan to confirm mandatory process 
variables are accessible and their values are within acceptable range.
