Please make sure the installation :ref:`pre-requisite-reference-label` are met.

This example shows how to verify the quality of data in an HDF file.
This example takes two mandatory command line arguments:
conf: a string defining the configuration file. If only path is defined, the name 'dqconfig.ini'
file: a file to be verified.
The configuration file configures limits that the quality calculation results is checked against.
The detailed results are stored into configured report file.
