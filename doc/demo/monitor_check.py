Please make sure the installation :ref:`pre-requisite-reference-label` are met.

This example shows how to verify newly created or modified files in a monitored folder.
This example takes three command line arguments:
type: a string defining data type being processed; can be 'data_dark', 'data_white' or 'data'.
num_files: an integer value specifying how many files will be processed
report_by_files: a boolean value defining how the bad indexes should be reported. If True,
the bad indexes will be sorted by files the image belongs to, and the indexes will be relative
to the files. If False, the bad indexes are reported as a list of all indexes in sequence that
did not pass quality checks.

This test can be done at during data collection to confirm data quality
values are within acceptable range.
