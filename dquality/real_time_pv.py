"""
Please make sure the installation :ref:`pre-requisite-reference-label` are met.

This module feeds the data coming from detector to a process using queue. It interracts with a channel access
plug in of area detector. The read of frame data from channel access happens on event of frame counter change.
The change is detected with a callback. The data is passed to the consuming process.
This module requires configuration file with the following parameters:
'detector', a string defining the first prefix in area detector.
'no_frames', number of frames that will be fed
'args', optional, list of process specific parameters, they need to be parsed to the desired format in the wrapper
