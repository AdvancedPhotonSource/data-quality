    This function creates and initializes all variables and handles data received on a 'dataq' queue.

    This function is typically called as a new process. It takes a dataq parameter
    that is the queue on which data is received. It takes the dictionary containing limit values
    for the data type being processed, such as data_dark, data_white, or data.
    It takes a reportq parameter, a queue, which is used to report results.
    The quality_checks is a dictionary, where the keys are quality checks methods ids (constants defined in
    dquality.common.constants) and values are lislts of statistical quality check methods ids that use results from the
    method defined as a key.

    The initialization constrains of creating aggregate instance to track results for a data type,
    queue for quality checks results passing, queue for statistical quality checks results passing,
    and initializing variables.

    This function has a loop that retrieves data from the data queue, runs a sequence of
    validation methods on the data, and retrieves results from the results queues.
    Each result object contains information whether the data was out of limits, in addition
    to the value and index. Each result is additionally evaluated with relation to the previously
    accumulated results.

    The loop is interrupted when the data queue received end of data element, and all
    processes produced results.


    Parameters
    ----------
    dataq : Queue
        data queuel; data is received in this queue

    limits : dictionary
        a dictionary of limits for the processed data type

    reportq : Queue
        results queue; used to pass results to the calling process

    quality_checks : dict
        a dictionary by data type of quelity check dictionaries:
        keys are ids of the basic quality check methods, and values are lists of statistical methods ids;
        the statistical methods use result from the "key" basic quality method.

    consumers : dict
        a dictionary containing consumer processes to run, and their parameters

    feedback_obj : Feedback
        a Feedback container that contains information for the real-time feedback. Defaulted to None.
