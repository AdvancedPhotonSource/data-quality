"""
Please make sure the installation :ref:`pre-requisite-reference-label` are met.

This module feeds data coming from ZeroMQ server to a process using queue. The parsing of the message is customized
for the BlueSky use case. Other cases may be added later.
The data, which represents a frame captured by detector, is received in two parts. The first part is received as json
stream and contains data attributes, such shape, type, theta and counter associated with this frame.
The second part is frame in bytes.
The frame array along with the received attributes is packed into Python object and sent to process defined in adapter
over queue.

This module requires configuration file with the following parameters:
'zmq_rcv_port' - the ZeroMQ port
